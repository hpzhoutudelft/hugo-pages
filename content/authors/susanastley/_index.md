I am a Professor of Intelligent Medical Imaging at The University of Manchester.  My research focuses on advanced imaging techniques and computer-aided methods for predicting the risk of breast cancer and early detection of the disease. Key areas include analysing mammographic density and texture as biomarkers for both cancer risk and the efficacy of mammography screening. My work encompasses technology evaluation in a clinical setting, equity in healthcare, and observer performance studies.
